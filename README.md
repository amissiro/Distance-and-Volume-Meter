Distance-and-Volume-Meter
=========================

By using an Atmel Studio, we programmed an Atmega32 microcontroller to calculate the distance of an object is from a sensor that was attached to the board.  The board consisted of the microcontroller itself, sensor (H2SR04), speaker, LCD screen, and a keypad. The microcontroller was also capable of calculating a volume of an object by placing the sensor inside of a hollow object.
